            These are all the projects I have done for my undergraduate
            <a href=https://www.bu.edu/academics/eng/courses/eng-me-360/"> ME360 product design class </a>
            from Boston University. Syllabus found
            <a href="https://www.bu.edu/eng/files/2022/02/ME360_Spring2022_Syllabus.pdf">here</a>.
            Goals of the class were to take a sketch of a design, and turn it into a well thought out
            product.
