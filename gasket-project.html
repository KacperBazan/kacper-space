        <h1>Gasket Project</h1>
        <aside>
            This project involved measuring, modeling and machining a gasket for a aluminum block with
            some standard holes and pins. The gasket was made to match the cross section of the block.
            Calipers were used to measure the block dimensions. The gasket was modeled in SolidWorks and
            then machined on a CNC mill with the help of GibbsCAM. The gasket was made from a 1/16" thick
            piece of white plastic.
